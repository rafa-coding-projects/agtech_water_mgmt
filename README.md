# Identification of water deficit in plants

Data collection system developed for taking RGB, infra-red images and depth sensor data. The infra-red images are used to identify the clorophil generation activity on the leaves which is an indirect indicator of water content. The system consists of an automated mechanical frame carrying 2-DOF carts carrying  cameras driven by stepper motors. The system design and code are open source and can be checked [here](https://github.com/ARoS-NCSU/PlantPhenotypingPlatform).
